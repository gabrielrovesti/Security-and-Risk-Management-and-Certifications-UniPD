About the exam (only Belli was present in the first exam):

- 1 hour for attending students (4 questions), 1 hour and a half for non-attending (10 questions)
- spaces are very few to actually write (6 rows basically, so try to be as concise as possible, not a problem if you go out from the row a bit)

Results for reports (I asked Belli) should come with the exam itself, as imagined by us
